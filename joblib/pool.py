"""Custom implementation of multiprocessing.Pool with custom pickler

This module provides efficient ways of working with data stored in
shared memory with numpy.memmap arrays without inducing any memory
copy between the parent and child processes.

This module should not be imported if multiprocessing is not
available.  as it implements subclasses of multiprocessing Pool
that uses a custom alternative to SimpleQueue
